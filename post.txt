## Project Information
The **New Zealand Aid Programme**, acting for and on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade **(MFAT)**, has appointed a Panel of specialist advisers and organisations with a wide range of skills, capabilities and areas of expertise across the **Agriculture** sector. This range reflects the diverse and international nature of New Zealand Aid Programme work that is often conducted in niche areas of specific regions and countries. MFAT will use the Panel as its preferred sourcing method for **agriculture sector specialists** to support the delivery of international development activities, and will open for a two year term with the option to extend for an additional two years at MFATâ€™s discretion.

**HTSPE**, with their partner **AgFirst New Zealand**, is one of the contractors on a pre-approved list of suppliers who are available to provide MFAT with the specified services outlined in the Deed of Standing Offer. Over time, MFAT may expand the panel to meet evolving business needs or if they require additional specialisms.

The 16 agriculture specialisms provided across the Panel are:
* **Agribusiness** e.g. attracting investors to the agricultural industry; preparing a range of policy options for agribusiness development; designing and implementing livelihood projects;
